# Security Fixes and Best Practices

This document outlines the security improvements made to the Pathfinder Loot Tracker application.

## Critical Security Fixes Applied

### 1. SQL Injection Prevention (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Direct string interpolation of table and column names in SQL queries could allow SQL injection attacks.

**Fix**: 
- Added whitelist validation for all table and column names in `dbUtils.js`
- All dynamic SQL identifiers are now validated against allowed lists
- Added pattern validation to ensure identifiers only contain safe characters
- Used quoted identifiers in queries for additional safety

### 2. Request Body Size Limits

**Issue**: No limits on request body size could lead to DoS attacks.

**Fix**:
- Added 10MB limit for JSON bodies
- Added 10MB limit for URL-encoded bodies
- Enforced strict JSON parsing (only objects and arrays)

### 3. Security Headers

**Issue**: Missing important security headers.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive security headers via Helmet:
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Forces HTTPS connections
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`: Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection`: Additional XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`: Controls referrer information
- Removed `X-Powered-By` header to hide technology stack

### 4. Environment Variable Security

**Issue**: Sensitive credentials hardcoded in docker-compose.yml

**Fix**:
- Created `.env.example` template files
- Created secure `docker-compose.secure.yml` that uses environment variables
- Added `generate-secrets.sh` script to generate secure random secrets
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive files

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Setup

1. **Generate Secure Secrets**:
   ```bash
   cd docker
   ./generate-secrets.sh
   ```

2. **Create Environment Files**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Copy `docker/.env.docker.example` to `docker/.env.docker`
   - Fill in all values with secure credentials

3. **Use Secure Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.secure.yml --env-file docker/.env.docker up -d
   ```

### Database Security

- All queries use parameterized statements
- Table and column names are validated against whitelists
- Database credentials should be strong and unique per environment
- Regular backups should be encrypted and stored securely

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Role-based access control (Player/DM)
- CSRF protection on all state-changing endpoints
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)

### API Security

- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Stricter rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- CORS configured with explicit origin whitelist
- Request body size limits
- Input validation on all endpoints

### Deployment Security

1. **Always use HTTPS in production**
2. **Never commit `.env` files or secrets to version control**
3. **Rotate secrets regularly**
4. **Keep dependencies updated**
5. **Monitor logs for suspicious activity**
6. **Use strong, unique passwords for all services**

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] Generated strong, unique JWT secrets (64+ characters)
- [ ] Generated strong database passwords
- [ ] Created `.env` files with all required values
- [ ] Verified `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Configured HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production` in production
- [ ] Configured proper CORS origins for your domains
- [ ] Enabled firewall rules to restrict database access
- [ ] Set up log monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configured automated backups

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email security@yourdomain.com instead of using the issue tracker.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Add Web Application Firewall (WAF)** for additional protection
2. **Implement API versioning** for future compatibility
3. **Add request signing** for critical operations
4. **Implement audit logging** for sensitive operations
5. **Consider adding 2FA** for user accounts
6. **Regular security audits** and penetration testing

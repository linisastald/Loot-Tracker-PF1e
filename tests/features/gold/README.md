## Integration with Loot Management

The gold management system integrates seamlessly with the loot management system:
- **Sale Processing**: Loot sales automatically create gold deposits
- **Character Payments**: Distribution tracking affects character balances
- **Party Funds**: Party loot purchases use shared gold resources
- **Financial Reporting**: Combined loot value and gold balance reporting

This comprehensive test suite ensures the gold management system maintains financial accuracy and provides a robust foundation for the campaign's economic tracking.

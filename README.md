## Updates

### 7.11.24 1144p 
- Spilt Stack is broken, need to be fixed
- Multiple views need session date readded in Month, DD, YYYY format
- Kept Party and Kept Character need columns for Kept on with Month, DD, YYYY format
- Still need to add the sold page, but this will require a new table I think 
- Made it so that only one character can be active at a time

### 7.11.24 308a 
- Gold Transations page has distribute buttons, but they are untested as I need to add test characters

### 7.11.24 125a 
- Unprocessed loot page 'complete'
  - Needs bug testing with users

### 7.10.24 520p

### 7.10.24 155p 
- Redesign of DB in progress

### 7.8.24 213p 
- Loot entry now accepts items and gold, can submit multiple lines
- Unprocessed loot view shows details and condenses items, buttons dont work yet

### 7.7.24 1116p 
- Can load application
- Can input item, but the input page does not have the correct input details
- None of the views show anything

## Features to be Added

### Login
- **~~Login via Character Name and Password~~**
- Google Login?

### Loot Entry
- **Item Name**: Autofill based on a database of items but allow custom input as well.
  - Autofill type and other hidden attributes if item is found

### Party Kept Loot
- **Potion/Scroll Usage**: One button for when potions or scrolls are used.

### Sold View
- **Record**: Record of what was sold on what day.
- Show total GP made at top

### Campaign Settings
- This page will set things like 
  - whose appraisals count for average appraisal
  - Track individual takings from party loot?
  - Number of players

### User Settings
- Theme settings
- ~~Appraisal bonus setting~~
- Identification setting 

### DM Pages
- Allow setting what an unidentified item is without revealing to the players
- Sell pending items(maybe better on unprocessed loot page as DM only option?)

## Additional Features (Less Important)
- **Session Tracking**: Who showed on what day.
- **Spell Book Page**
- **Appraisal Calculation**: Automatically calculate appraisal amounts for each character at the time of input.

## Plan
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Each campaign will have its own container, eliminating the need to include features to separate different campaigns.

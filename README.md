## Additional Features (Less Important)
- **Session Tracking**: Who showed on what day.
- **Wealth by Level Check**: (Less important, I think Herolab does it).
- **Spell Book Page**

## Plan
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Each campaign will have its own container, eliminating the need to include features to separate different campaigns.
